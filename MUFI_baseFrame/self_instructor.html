            Robby
            <article class="article">Robby the Seal is Pingu's best friend, he and Robby first met in Pingu goes Fishing. He also appeared to have tagged along with Pingu when he moved to the city. He is voiced by Carlo Bonomi, David Sant & Fumiya Tanaka.Not so much is known about Robby's background.

                Robby first met Pingu whilst he out fishing, but, they did not at first get along. Robby kept stealing and eating the bait Pingu was using to fish and tricked him into thinking he was collecting lots of fish when it was the same one. Eventually, Pingu catches Robby and pursues him and stops him from escaping back into the sea by covering up the two holes in the ice. Robby tries to escape, but he hurts his flipper and Pingu felt regretful so he comforts him, which causes Robby's flipper to heal.

                Recognizing the goodness in Pingu's soul, Robby returns his fishing pole and rewards his sensitivity with a large fish. Pingu, in return, gives Robby a piece of his bait to eat and the two of them became best friends.

                Robby is also a talented musician and can play the accordion and drums.
